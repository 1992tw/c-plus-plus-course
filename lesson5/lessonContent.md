## Assignment

Implement Basic Data Structures in C++

### Objective

Gain hands-on experience in implementing some basic data structures such as stack and queue in C++.

### Expected Capabilities

- Implement stack using arrays
- Implement queue using linked lists
- Understand potential practical applications

### Instructions

#### Part 1

**Implement Stack Using Array**

Develop a stack data structure using an array in C++ and test its primary operations like push and pop.

```
class Stack { int arr[MAX]; int top; /* Implement push, pop */ };
```

#### Part 2

**Implement Queue Using Linked List**

Create a queue data structure using a linked list in C++ and implement operations such as enQueue and deQueue.

```
struct Node { int data; Node* next; }; class Queue { Node *front, *rear; /* Implement enQueue, deQueue */ };
```

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Write and Test Stack Operations

Implement and verify stack operations such as push, pop, and display using arrays.

```
// Code for push, pop functions
```

#### Task 2: Write and Test Queue Operations

Implement and verify queue operations like enQueue, deQueue, and display using linked lists.

```
// Code for enQueue, deQueue functions
```

### Submission Instructions

Submit the source code along with screenshots of the output for each data structure operation.

### Checklist

### Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. Common data structures in C++ include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

**Quizzes:**

**What is an example of a data structure?**

- Integer
- Array
- Function

**Answer:** Array

### Algorithms and Their Analysis

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Analyzing algorithms involves determining the efficiency and performance, often through time and space complexity analysis. Big O notation is commonly used as a measure of complexity.

**Code Examples:**

```
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { /*...*/} // O(n)
```

```
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < m; j++) { /*...*/ } } // O(n*m)
```
