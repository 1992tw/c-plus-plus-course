# Algorithms and Their Analysis

## Content

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Analyzing algorithms involves determining the efficiency and performance, often through time and space complexity analysis. Big O notation is commonly used as a measure of complexity.

## Code Examples

```
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { /*...*/} // O(n)
```

```
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { for(int j = 0; j < m; j++) { /*...*/ } } // O(n*m)
```
